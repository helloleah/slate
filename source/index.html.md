# Introduction

Welcome to the ICUBAM API! You can use our API to access ICUBAM API endpoints, which can get information on various bed counts, ICUs, and regions in our database.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.

More information about ICUBAM and its source code can be found on <a href='https://github.com/icubam/icubam'>Github</a>.
